### Overview
This is a fun little project using JavaScript and an HTML5 canvas, paired with some parametric equations
used to simulate simple orbits. 

The orbits are paired with recorded piano sounds at specific intervals, in this way, creating a sort of musical-instrument.
The buttons create notes that move in an elipsis and emit a tone at a particular point.
